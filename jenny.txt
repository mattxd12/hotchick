Chapter 1

Jenny. I love you Jenny.

Chapter 2

When we met, it was raining and my hands were shaking. I said to myself that I
had to approach you or I would never forgive myself.

Chapter 3

He looked Jenny in the eyes and said to her “erm.. when I said I love you
I meant the universal you… not just you, exclusively, Jenny. I’m sure you’re
quite lovable but I’ve been getting really into yoga lately, by the way, and
its really helped me express my love for humanity as a whole and manifesting
that through expressing that on an individual basis.” After he spoke these
words he and Jenny both sighed in relief and began to talk about their jobs
as coders.

Chapter 4

"ICP is coming to town and I'm going with some friends. You might be able
to get a ticket if you go talk to my friend Horatio."
